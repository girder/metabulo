p.
  This chart shows a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) loadings plot. The
  Pearson correlation of each metabolite with the displayed principal
  components is plotted in a scatter plot. A reticle appears at the origin
  for help in interpreting the plotted points as vectors.

p.
  Hovering the mouse pointer over a point shows the name of the metabolite,
  as well as exact values for correlation with the two principal components.

p.
  The menu contains options for selecting which components to show in the
  plot, as well as a toggle for turning the reticle display on and off.
